# micrograd

This implementation showcases micrograd, an autograd engine with built-in backpropagation, along with a neural network library layered on top of it as shown in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ). 

The next step is to train the MLP on a small dataset.
